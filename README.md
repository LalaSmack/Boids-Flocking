- Real-time flocking simulation with colorful boids  
- **Sliders** to adjust:
  - Cohesion strength  
  - Alignment strength  
  - Separation strength  
- Screen boundary handling to keep boids in view  
- Boids react to a **predator** that actively chases them  
- Clean, modular code using `pygame_gui`
